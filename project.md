# Project

The course project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class to a problem of your interest. Potential projects fall into two tracks:
- *Applications*: Pick a real-world problem and apply deep networks to solve it.
- *Models*: Build a new model or algorithm, or a variant of existing models, and apply it to a task. This track might be more challenging, but could lead to a publishable piece of work.

Be creative and ambitious!

### Agenda

- Project proposal, due by **March 1, 2019 at 23:59**.
- Project code and report, due by **April 26, 2019 at 23:59**.
- Project presentations on May 3, 10 and 17, 2019.

Projects should be submitted through the [Montefiore submission platform](https://submit.montefiore.ulg.ac.be).

### Instructions

- Students can work in groups of maximum 3 students.
- Each group must write a short (1-2 pages) research project proposal. It should include a description of a minimum viable project, some nice-to-haves if time allows, and a short review of related work.
- Towards the end of the class, you will submit a project report (around 4 to 8 pages), in the format of a machine learning conference paper.
- At the end of the course everyone will present their project to the class.
- The grade will depend on the ideas, how well you present them in the report, how clearly you position your work relative to existing literature, how illuminating your experiments are, and how well-supported your conclusions are.
- Both the project proposal and the project report should follow the LaTex template [`template-report.tex`](https://glouppe.github.io/info8010-deep-learning/template-report.tex).

### Evaluation guidelines

Report:
1) Clarity: quality of the abstract and introduction with a clear formulation of the research question, is there a proper related-work section and explanation of the experimental setup? Are the results of the report overall scientifically sound and replicable?

2) Writing style: is the paper properly formatted and structured? does it not contain language errors? are the figures and tables properly captioned and interpretable?

3) Results: do the results support the original research question? why/why not? Are they clearly presented and convincing?

4) Development: are the contributions of the group to the development of the project well defined? what has been implemented with respect to the original research questions, what has been re-used from existing coding directories?
